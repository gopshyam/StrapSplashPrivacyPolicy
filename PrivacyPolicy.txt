==================    Strap Splash Privacy Policy   ==================

Effective: August 10, 2018

I’m Shyam. Strap Splash is a passion project I’ve been working on for a while to try and implement a concept that I found interesting. 
Protecting your privacy is extremely important to me. 
For this reason, no information about you or the people that you interact with while using this app is collected or permanently stored. 

The application uses your device camera and extracts some information about what is visible through the camera. 
This information is vital to the operation of the application and may be temporarily stored in application memory. 
This information does not persist and can only be accessed by the processes that are a part of the application. 
However, if you wish to revoke access to this feature even though it could affect the operation of the application, you may do so by writing to gopal.shyam94@gmail.com. 

I would again like to reiterate that no data is stored by the application or made available to third parties or developers of the application. 
In case of any further questions, feel free to contact me at gopal.shyam94@gmail.com.
